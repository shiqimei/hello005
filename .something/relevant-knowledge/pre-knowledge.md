- **Content Security Policy**: XSS prevention while allowing CDN resources
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for multi-device layouts

## Accessibility Knowledge
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and programmatic announcements
- **High Contrast Mode**: Visual accessibility for users with visual impairments
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete game control without mouse interaction
- **Speech Synthesis**: Audio feedback for game events and state changes

## Implementation Patterns Knowledge
- **Entity-Component System**: Separation of concerns between game logic, rendering, and UI

- **State Management**: Clear game state transitions with proper event handling
- **Modular Design**: Independent components for easier testing and maintenance

## Additional Knowledge from Knowledge Base

### Technical Design Best Practices for 3D Browser Games
- **Fixed timestep game loops** with RequestAnimationFrame - Ensures consistent game behavior across different frame rates
- **Separate rendering pipeline** from game logic for better performance
- **State machines** for game flow management (MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER)

### Three.js Specific Optimization Strategies
- **Instance rendering** for repeated geometry (game blocks) - Critical for Tetris blocks performance
- **Object pooling** to prevent garbage collection spikes - Reuse block objects instead of creating/destroying
- **Orthographic cameras** provide better clarity for grid-based gameplay - Better than perspective for Tetris
- **Minimal geometry creation/destruction** during active gameplay - Pre-create and reuse geometries

### Performance Targets
- **Desktop**: 60 FPS target, 30 FPS minimum
- **Tablet**: 45 FPS target, 30 FPS minimum  
- **Mobile**: 30 FPS target, 20 FPS minimum
- **Load time**: <5 seconds on standard connections

### Browser Compatibility Strategy
- **Target WebGL 1.0** for broader support - Avoid WebGL 2.0 features for wider compatibility
- **Feature detection** with graceful degradation - Handle unsupported features gracefully
- **Support modern browsers**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- **Handle WebGL context loss** with auto-recovery - Important for mobile devices and power management

### Security Considerations
- **CSP headers**: Allow CDN sources for Three.js but minimize 'unsafe-inline'
- **Local storage only** for non-sensitive preferences (high scores, settings)
- **Input validation** for all game actions - Prevent cheating and crashes

### Data Model Design
- **TypeScript interfaces** for game state structure - Type safety and better IDE support
- **Efficient 3D arrays** for grid-based games (board[x][y][z]) - Perfect for 3D Tetris grid
- **Separate rendering data** from game logic data - Clean separation of concerns
- **Enum-based state management** for clarity - Use enums for block types, game states, etc.

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Global error boundaries** for graceful degradation
- **WebGL context loss recovery** mechanisms
- **Performance monitoring** with automatic quality adjustment
- **User-friendly error messages** for technical failures

### Key Implementation Recommendations for 3D Tetris
1. **Use orthographic camera** for clearer grid visualization
2. **Implement object pooling** for tetrimino blocks to avoid GC pressure
3. **Use instanced rendering** for drawing multiple blocks efficiently
4. **Structure game state** with TypeScript interfaces and 3D arrays
5. **Implement WebGL context loss recovery** for robustness
6. **Target 60 FPS on desktop**, 30 FPS on mobile
7. **Use ECS pattern** for clean, modular game object management
8. **Separate game logic** from rendering for better maintainability
